# SoftwareProject_Vitrubar

Important: this project was made together with my study partner. As it is a university project that had to be done in limited time, of course the functionality is not full, it is more of a skeleton with basic setup that has a potential for further development. The stress is on backend side, frontend was developed on a primitive level during the last iteration.

## Idea: 
The idea behind Virtubar is to create an online platform with different "locations" that you can visit - online bars, parties, any sort of online gathering. 
The Virtubar contains various spaces, each space can have several rooms with specified topic. Spaces can be configured depending on a desired format. 

### The functionality that is already there:
- sign up
- sign in
- space creation
- room creation
- basic space/room configuration
- landing page
- webserver
- database

### Tools:

Frontend is written in Vue.js
Backend in Java+Javalin+Hibernate
